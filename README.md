# Angular Course Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.2.

This project uses Angular and Firebase to build a simple recipe book application for restaurants to manage recipes and ingredients.

This recipe book application includes three main parts: authentication, recipes and shopping list.

The application can implement:
* Account sign up, login and logout;
* Recipes storage and fetch;
* Single recipe creation, update and deletion;
* Needed ingredients management in shopping list.

This project works with NgRx to manage application state.
